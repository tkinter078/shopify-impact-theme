But, the FDA does regulate both dietary supplements and dietary ingredients. At SwiftSupple, we follow what the FDA established for dietary supplements in 2007 called \"current Good Manufacturing Practice\" (cGMP) regulations requiring that manufacturers evaluate their products through testing identity, purity, strength, and composition. We not only tested for stability with our manufacturers, but also did 3rd-party testing for potency of active ingredients, adulterants like heavy metals and microbes, allergens, rancidity and other unwanted contaminants.</p>"
